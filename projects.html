            <h3>Customized Article Delivery with AI - Optimized Time Slot</h3>
            <p>
                This project aimed to develop an AI-based solution for optimizing delivery time slots for articles and packages. The primary objective was to enhance the efficiency of delivery services by predicting the best time slots for delivery based on historical data and user preferences.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Technologies Used</strong>: Python, Machine Learning (scikit-learn), Pandas, NumPy, Flask for the web application.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Key Features</strong>:
                <ul>
                    <li>Data Collection: Gathered historical delivery data, including time, location, and customer feedback.</li>
                    <li>Data Analysis: Used Pandas and NumPy for data cleaning and analysis to identify patterns in delivery times.</li>
                    <li>Machine Learning Model: Developed a predictive model using scikit-learn to forecast optimal delivery time slots.</li>
                    <li>User Interface: Created a user-friendly web application using Flask, allowing users to input their preferences and receive optimized delivery suggestions.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Outcome</strong>: The project successfully reduced delivery times by an average of 20% and improved customer satisfaction by providing more accurate delivery windows.
            </p>
        
            <h3>Fake News Detection</h3>
            <p>
                In this project, I developed a machine learning model to classify news articles as either fake or genuine. The goal was to combat the spread of misinformation by providing users with a reliable tool to verify the authenticity of news content.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Technologies Used</strong>: Python, Natural Language Processing (NLP), scikit-learn, NLTK, Flask for the web application.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Key Features</strong>:
                <ul>
                    <li>Data Collection: Collected a dataset of news articles labeled as fake or real from various sources.</li>
                    <li>Text Preprocessing: Utilized NLTK for text cleaning, tokenization, and stemming to prepare the data for analysis.</li>
                    <li>Model Training: Implemented various machine learning algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest) to train the model on the dataset.</li>
                    <li>Web Application: Developed a web interface using Flask, allowing users to input news articles and receive real-time classification results.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Outcome</strong>: The model achieved an accuracy of over 85% in classifying news articles, providing users with a valuable tool to identify fake news and make informed decisions.
            </p>
        
            <h3>PCB Design and Prototyping</h3>
            <p>
                This project involved designing and prototyping a printed circuit board (PCB) for an IC555-based application. The objective was to create a functional prototype that could be used in various electronic projects.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Technologies Used</strong>: KiCAD for PCB design, soldering tools for prototyping.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Key Features</strong>:
                <ul>
                    <li>Understanding PCB Layout: Gained knowledge of PCB layers, component placement, and routing techniques.</li>
                    <li>Design Process: Used KiCAD to create schematics and layout for the IC555 timer circuit.</li>
                    <li>Prototyping: Assembled the PCB and tested its functionality in various applications, such as timers and oscillators.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Outcome</strong>: Successfully created a working prototype that demonstrated the capabilities of the IC555 timer, enhancing my skills in electronics design and prototyping.
